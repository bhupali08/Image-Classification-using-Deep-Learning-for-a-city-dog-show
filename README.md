# Image-Classification-using-Deep-Learning-for-a-city-dog-show
creating multiple deep learning based image classifiers to identify dog breeds and comparing their performances to select the best model. 
The two goals of the model are to:
1. detect whether the given image by the contestant is of a dog or not (binary classification problem)

2. If the provided image is of a dog, automatically detecting the breed of the dog for faster and more accurate record keeping. 

Deep learning model architectures Tested: AlexNet, VGG16, and Resnet18.

Best performing model: AlexNet
